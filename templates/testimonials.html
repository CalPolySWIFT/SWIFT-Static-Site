                        <p><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i>I joined SWIFT because it was the sister club to CCDC, and I
                            wanted to learn more about Linux and the skill needed to be on the CCDC team. SWIFT was a
                            great community, and I enjoyed both the desire that everyone had to learn as well as the
                            camaraderie. Probably my favorite event was Tech Symposium. We were always able to get
                            speakers to give talks on interesting topics, and I liked that it always spanned a huge
                            breadth of disciplines. SWIFT (and the knowledge gained therein) landed me my first job
                            working at Northrop Grumman. I was building high performance computing clusters with Linux,
                            and I was one of the only interns who had ever seen a bash prompt before. My Unix and code
                            background that I got from SWIFT continues to help to this day with my engineering job. I
                            still work at Northrop Grumman. <i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i></p>

                            School was fine but I knew that classes weren't everything so I joined some friends in SWIFT
                            and through it found a world of experience I couldn't have gotten anywhere else and lasting
                            friendships. I owe SWIFT a debt for all of my success and can't speak highly enough of it.

                            Got into SWIFT through CCDC collective. Got very involved in the industry, got free or
                            subsidized conferences, events. Met and gained professional relationships with references
                            for future and current jobs as well as the right profs and staff at CPP. Got too much (never
                            enough) free pizza. It's good shit, do it. What, 256 characters? Too bad. <i

                            I joined SWIFT because I was seeking technical and like minded friends on campus. My
                            involvement in the club helped me find exciting projects and competitions to get involved in
                            while allowing me to be surrounded by peers that I could work with and learn from. Overall,
                            SWIFT turned out to be an integral part of my college experience because it motivated me to
                            learn the technical topics I needed to succeed in my career while providing me with an
                            awesome group of friends I could identify with! <i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i></p>

                            I joined SWIFT because I attended Cal Poly Pomona to participate on its CCDC team. All the
                            CCDC members recommended joining SWIFT, going to the meetings, and the events.

                            I enjoyed the weekly meetings where industry professionals and alumni would give talks on
                            topics related to security, networking, and other areas related to computers. ALSAS and Red
                            Team workshops were also fun events that I enjoyed attending. I really enjoyed attending
                            conferences with SWIFT members and alumni.

                            SWIFT helped in my career by introducing and teaching me about topics that were related to
                            information security, attending conferences where I could meet new people and learn about
                            new topics, and meeting alumni who provided advice.

                            I am currently an Associate Consultant with Optiv Security on the Attack and Penetration
                            team. <i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i></p>
