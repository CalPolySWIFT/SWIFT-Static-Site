                            everyone had to learning. SWIFT landed me my first job working at Northrop Grumman. I was
                            building high performance computing clusters with Linux, and I was one of the only interns
                            who had ever seen a bash prompt before. My Unix and code background that I got from SWIFT
                            continues to help to this day with my engineering job. <i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i></p>

                            School was fine but I knew that classes were not everything. With so many clubs on campus, I
                            decided to join SWIFT. Throughout school, I met so many people and formed, not only
                            connected with so many motivated and passionate people but I also found a world of
                            experience that I could not have gotten anywhere else. I owe it to SWIFT for my success and
                            cannot stop speaking highly enough of it. <i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i></p>

                            I originally got into SWIFT through the Cyber Defense club at Cal Poly Pomona. I also got
                            very involved in the industry, went to conferences, and events. I also had the opportunity
                            to gain professional relationships with references for future and current jobs as well.
                            SWIFT is truly an awesome club, you will not regret it. <i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i>

                            I joined SWIFT because I was seeking technical and like minded friends on campus. My

                            while allowing me to be surrounded by peers that I could work with and learn from. Overall,

                            Network, Network, Network and go to Fragnite. Go to SWIFT meetings and make friends. Before
                            I graduated I attended the spring Fragnite and participated in league matches until
                            midnight. It was such a great event. I learned a lot from the SWIFT meetings and by hanging
                            out with the SWIFT Club. Honestly, SWIFT is much more than just a club itâ€™s a community of
