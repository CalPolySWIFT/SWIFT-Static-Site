                    <p>We are Students with an Interest in the Future of Technology, we are the premier information
                        technology and security organization at Cal Poly Pomona. We aim to inspire and create a
                        generation of students who are aware and capable of dealing with the dynamic landscape of
                        information security, cyber security, and information technology. Together we can build a secure
                        future through training, experience, and education. Let's work together to create and
                        learn something new. Don't just take our word for it. Whether you are an industry
                        professional or a curious student, take a look at our previous events. While you're at it,
                        come to one of our unique workshops, trainings, or conferences and become part of SWIFT.

                            fluid pace of technology and industry. It is our goal to both continue these efforts, as
                            well as expand and contribute back to the community. We teach the skills to use computer
                            systems and the skills necessary to learn new systems. In an age when technology changes
                            on a weekly basis, we strive to keep members informed and equipped to thrive in such an
                            environment.</p>

                        SWIFT holds weekly <a href="general_meetings.html">general meetings</a> with both in-house and
                        external speakers. These meetings cover relevant topics in computer and technology industries.
                        Live demos of software and hardware are common. In addition to the weekly meetings, SWIFT hosts
                        a number of free workshops that teach a variety of skills including Linux installation, network
                        security, and penetration testing. These workshops are hands-on and are designed to let members
                        get hands-on experience with real technology. We also host social events such as a quarterly LAN
                        party.
