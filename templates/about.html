                            fluid pace of technology and industry. It is our goal to both continue these efforts, as
                            well as expand and contribute back to the community. We teach the skills to use computer
                            systems and the skills necessary to learn new systems. In an age when technology changes
                            on a weekly basis, we strive to keep members informed and equipped to thrive in such an
                            environment.</p>

                        SWIFT holds weekly general meetings with both in-house and external speakers. These meetings
                        cover relevant topics in computer and technology industries. Live demos of software and
                        hardware are common. In addition to the weekly meetings, SWIFT hosts a number of free
                        workshops that teach a variety of skills including Linux installation, network security, and
                        penetration testing. These workshops are hands-on and are designed to let members get
                        hands-on experience with real technology. We also host social events such as a quarterly LAN
                        party.
