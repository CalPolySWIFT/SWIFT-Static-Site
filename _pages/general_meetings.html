                        SWIFT holds weekly general meetings with both in-house and external speakers. These meetings
                        cover relevant topics in computer and technology industries. Live demos of software and
                        hardware are common. In addition to the weekly meetings, SWIFT hosts a number of free
                        workshops that teach a variety of skills including Linux installation, network security, and
                        penetration testing. These workshops are hands-on and are designed to let members get
                        hands-on experience with real technology. We also host social events such as a quarterly LAN
                        party.
