                    <h3>SWIFT's Mission</h3>

                    <p>We are Students with an Interest in the Future of Technology, we are the premier information
                        technology and security organization at Cal Poly Pomona. We aim to inspire and create a
                        generation of students who are aware and capable of dealing with the dynamic landscape of
                        information security, cyber security, and information technology. Together we can build a secure
                        future through training, experience, and education. Let's work together to create and
                        learn something new. Don't just take our word for it. Whether you are an industry
                        professional or a curious student, take a look at our previous events. While you're at it,
                        come to one of our unique workshops, trainings, or conferences and become part of SWIFT.
                    </p>

                    <h3>What we do</h3>

                    <p>Being a part of SWIFT is much more then being a part of an organization. SWIFT is a community.
                        We believe strongly in providing students with opportunities that can be obtained nowhere else
                        and help build skills through on-campus and off-campus events. As such, we believe in providing
                        and understanding the skills required to excel in the industry through workshops and activities
                        that build skills and friendships.
                    </p>

                    <p>Throughout the year SWIFT runs weekly meetings alternating between workshop trainings and
                        discussions providing students a way to build up their skills in an alternating cycle of
                        meetings.
                    </p>

                    <p>Additionally, SWIFT runs workshops and trainings on all aspects of System Administration and
                        Cyber Security including:
                    </p>

                    </ul>

                    <p>These events supplement weekly training and our large conference events that take place at least
                        once a quarter.

                    <h3>Events</h3>

                    <p>
                        SWIFT holds weekly <a href="general_meetings.html">general meetings</a> with both in-house and
                        external speakers. These meetings cover relevant topics in computer and technology industries.
                        Live demos of software and hardware are common. In addition to the weekly meetings, SWIFT hosts
                        a number of free workshops that teach a variety of skills including Linux installation, network
                        security, and penetration testing. These workshops are hands-on and are designed to let members
                        get hands-on experience with real technology. We also host social events such as a quarterly LAN
                        party.
                    </p>

                    <p>In order to excel at the skills needed, we encourage our members to attend and run workshops and
                        events. Through these exchange of knowledge we build skills and form partnerships far beyond the
                        campus to the industry and professionals at large. We have a long history of starting, running
                        events, and that are known for their in-depth nature and cover the full breadth of the industry.
                        SWIFT members are able to attend conferences like SCALE, the Southern California Linux Expo.
                    </p>
